    <p>
      Easy, cheesy, and incredibly delicious, this quick recipe ensures minimal cleanup while delivering ultimate comfort in every bite.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3-1/2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>1 package (16 ounces) elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>4 ounces Velveeta, cubed</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a Dutch oven, combine milk, water, and macaroni. Bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat and simmer until macaroni is tender and almost all the cooking liquid has been absorbed, 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in cheeses until melted. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Best cheese for mac and cheese is a classic sharp cheddar. It's best to shred your own, but in a pinch, you can certainly use packaged shredded cheese.</li>
      <li>You can make homemade mac and cheese creamier by cooking your pasta in milk. Try adding cream or yogurt to add in additional creaminess.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To make your homemade mac and cheese healthier, you can throw in some fresh veggies and sources of protein like chicken or turkey.</li>
      <li>You can also use whole wheat or a legume-based pasta to cut down on empty carbs and increase your daily protein intake.</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Reviews:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Absolutely perfect recipe. I used homemade velveeta, which came out perfect, and melted as expected in this recipe.</li>
        <li>I almost never make Mac and Cheese. This recipe was what I needed at the moment for a medically modified diet. It was good!I added a little dry mustard and a shake of beau monde. Topped with a sprinkle of green onions.</li>

  <h2 class="recipe-title">Shrimp Pasta Alfredo</h2>

  <p>
    Perfect for Weeknight Dinners or Special Occasions, Shrimp Pasta Alfredo Delivers Delicious Elegance.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups uncooked bow tie pasta</li>
    <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
    <li>1 pound peeled and deveined cooked medium shrimp, tails removed</li>
    <li>1 jar (15 ounces) Alfredo sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook pasta according to package directions, adding peas during the last 3 minutes of cooking; drain and return to pan.</li>
    <li>Stir in shrimp and sauce; heat through over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with cheese.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Shrimp Pasta Alfredo is delicious on its own, but you can also serve it with a side salad or garlic bread to complete the meal.</li>
    <li>If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. When reheating, add a splash of milk or cream to the pasta to revive the creaminess.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Be sure to cook the pasta al dente, which means it should have a slight bite to it. Overcooked pasta can become mushy when mixed with the sauce and shrimp.</li>
    <li>The recipe calls for peeled and deveined cooked medium shrimp with the tails removed. If you prefer, you can use raw shrimp and cook them separately before adding them to the pasta. If you're using frozen shrimp, thaw them thoroughly before cooking.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Reviews:</h3>

    Make pizza night an upscale affair with this fun twist on the traditional pie. A prebaked crust and prepared pesto keep things quick and easy.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 prebaked 12-inch pizza crust</li>
    <li>1/2 cup prepared pesto</li>
    <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 jars (6-1/2 ounces each) marinated artichoke hearts, drained</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Optional: Grated Parmesan cheese and minced fresh basil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°. Place crust on an ungreased 12-in. pizza pan. Spread with pesto. Arrange chicken and artichokes over top; sprinkle with cheese. Bake until golden brown, 10-12 minutes. If desired, top with Parmesan cheese and minced fresh basil.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>You can also try adding other toppings like sliced cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, or sliced black olives for additional taste and visual appeal.</li>
    <li>Pair it with a fresh green salad or some roasted vegetables to make it a complete meal.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use cubed cooked chicken breast for this recipe to save time. You can use leftover cooked chicken or quickly cook chicken breast specifically for this pizza. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and any additional herbs or spices to add flavor.</li>
    <li>You can add some shredded Parmesan or crumbled feta cheese for extra flavor. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can incorporate some ricotta or goat cheese.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Reviews:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a perfect alternative to regular pizza for dinner! My family loved it.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both loved this recipe. I should clarify that I used a different homemade pizza dough recipe. The only thing this pizza needed was a little salt and pepper, so the second time I made it, I added it after brushing the crust with olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
